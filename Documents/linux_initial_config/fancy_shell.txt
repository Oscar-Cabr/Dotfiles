----------------------------

Necessary packages:


zsh:		Modern and extensible shell.
starhip:	Quick and minimalist prompt, very personalizable.
git:		Necessary for some pluggins and remote config.
yay:		AUR package manager, required to install neofetch. (If having too flat installation of Arch, it could be cloned directly with git)
neofetch:	Shows system info once logged-in.	WARNING: Neofetch must cause error: target not found: neofetch because it no longer exists in habilitated official repos, it was moved to AUR (Arch User Repository).
fzf:		Fuzzy finder. (history, files)
fd:		Modern alternative to "find".
bat:		Alternative to "cat" with sintaxis highlighting.
ripgrep:	Alternative to "grep", quicker and with better output.
terminus-font:	Readable font for TTY.

-----------------------------

The first step is change the actual shell to zsh (more customizable) with the following command, then reboot.
chsh -s /bin/zsh
reboot

Then, the configuration of the zsh shell must be done in the file:
~/.zshrc
The same as:
/home/racso/.zshrc
That file gets executed every time a new session is initiated.

After every change, to see them applied you must do the following command:
source ~/.zshrc

-----------------------------

The zsh file:

"alias" define a word as something else.
e.g. if you always do "ls -a", you can save time making an alias:
alias ls='ls -a'
And everytime you do 'ls', will be the same as writing 'ls -a'.

To change the prompt to starship one, add the following line, "eval" executes the intializing code that starship generates dynamically for zsh.
eval "$(starship init zsh)"

To change default font can be done as:
setfont ter-m22n (or any other font available in ls /usr/share/kbd/consolefonts/)

-----------------------------

Starship prompt with toml file

Starship conf must be done in file:
~/.config/starship.toml

See starship documentation for further details.

-----------------------------

To change default font you can check the available fonts in:
ls /usr/share/kbd/consolefonts/

Once you choose one, add it to the file:
sudo nano /etc/vconsole.conf

As:
FONT=ter-m22n
