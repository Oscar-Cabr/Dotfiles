kitty is planned as the default terminal por hyprland, so its useful to make it so.

---------- kitty ----------

If kitty is getting in trouble while starting on hyprland for first time, start with alacritty then, try to execute kitty on alacritty from inside wayland.
With $WAYLAND_DISPLAY show the graphic library used by kitty: GLFW to connect with the screen. Sometimes this can have trouble with drivers or Wayland configs, so kitty must need specific enviroment or variable components wrong configurated.
alacritty, other way, uses Wayland from native, making better compatibility with GPUs or controllers. Its simplier and less dependent from specific graphic libraries, making it more stable.
Thats why kitty can't be launched from outside a graphic enviroment (e.g. TTY, bash, zsh).

Check if wayland is not in trouble executing the following in alacritty:
echo $WAYLAND_DISPLAY
echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE
They must show 'wayland' or kinda.

Create the doc ~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf with a basic configuration:
    font_family JetBrains Mono
    font_size 10.0
    enable_wayland yes
For that, first install the font with: sudo pacman -S ttf-jetbrains-mono

And finally, add the line: export KITTY_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1
In the ~/.zshrc file.

-------- fonts --------

Fonts installed with:

sudo pacman -S ttf-font-awesome
sudo pacman -S ttf-input-nerd noto-fonts noto-fonts-cjk noto-fonts-emoji

Input nerd is better for modern terminal like Kitty, Alacritty and Starship because has Nerd Fonts.
Noto Fonts is from Google supporting every language, excellent for internationalization, but without Nerd Fonts.
    CJK and emoji are source extentions for Noto, designed for covering scripts and icons not included in base font noto-fonts.
    CJK: Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Japanese, Korean.
    Emoji: Full emoji source compatible with Unicode, similar to Android one.

-------- clipboard --------

It is needed to install the following:

sudo pacman -S wl-clipboard
paru -S paru-bin cliphist

For installing paru you can clone precompiled binary for paru:

git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/paru-bin.git
cd paru-bin

And install it directly:

makepkg -si

paru-bin contains a precompiled binary from AUR.

With the dependencies now can add the following lines to hyprland.conf:

exec-once = cliphist wipe
exec-once = cliphist store

That only follows things copied with Ctrl+C, but for track things copied with mouse add the following:

exec-once = wl-paste --watch cliphist store
exec-once = wl-paste --watch --primary cliphist store

Finally, add the bind to open the clipboard easily with wofi:

bind = SUPER, V, exec, cliphist list | wofi --dmenu | cliphist decode | wl-copy
