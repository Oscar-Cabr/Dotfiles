To check whenever you have wifi you have to send and receive ping to certain IP's.
To do so, first you have to type the following command:
ip a show wlp3s0

And it must appear a line showing something like:
inet 192.168.1.81/24 ...

Indicating there's an IP assigned to the Wifi manager wlp3s0.

---

Then check if you have connection to the router:
ping -c 3 192.168.1.1

You have internet without DNS?
ping -c 3 1.1.1.1

You have internet with DNS working? (can navigate through the internet)
ping -c 3 archlinux.org

If there are 3 packets transmitted and received, then you're correctly connected to wifi.

--------------------------

The file with the data of the Wifi network you're into is in the route:
/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlp3s0.conf

Where is an item with the information of the public name of the wifi (ssid) and the password to the network (psk):
network={
    ssid="INFINITUM5356"
    psk="Sp5Kj1Mm3c"
}

You can change that info if you're changing your network.
Or even better add another network if you want to automatically connect in other places.
Once you effectively add the other network, recharge the service for connect to it:

sudo systemctl restart wpa_supplicant@wlp3s0.service

You can add the line:
    priority=10

Or any number. The higher priorit will have preference over other networks to be connected in case there are more than one at a certain moment.

--------------------------

To allow the auto-connection whenever the device is turned on, the following commands must be executed:

sudo systemctl enable wpa_supplicant@wlp3s0.service
To run wpa_supplicant automatically for wlp3s0 when initiating.

sudo systemctl enable dhcpcd.service
To ask the router for the IP whenever it connects.

--------------------------

Doing all this process needed the installation of the following packages:
dhcpcd wi wpa_supplicant nano

As first configuration after installing Arch on the computer.
